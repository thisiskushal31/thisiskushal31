## Purpose

This directory is designed to showcase:
- **Production projects** with detailed technical documentation
- **Case studies** highlighting impact, architecture, and implementation details
- **Project portfolios** tailored for specific opportunities
- **Technical deep-dives** for technical interviews and discussions

## Structure

Each project should be organized in its own subdirectory with:
- `README.md` - Project overview, impact, and key highlights

- `implementation.md` - Implementation details and code samples (if applicable)
- `metrics.md` - Quantifiable results and impact metrics

## Usage

- **For Interviews:** Reference specific projects during technical discussions

## Guidelines

- Keep project documentation professional and clear
- Include quantifiable metrics and impact
