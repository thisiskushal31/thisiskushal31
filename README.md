# 👋 Hey there, I'm Kushal Gupta

Welcome to my GitHub space! I'm an **Experienced Software Engineer**—I work across large-scale **distributed** and **non-distributed** production infrastructure, end-to-end from design through monitoring and reliability, with a focus on **security**, **reliability**, and **scalability**. I automate what can be automated in between. I work the full lifecycle: design → build → deploy → operate → monitor → iterate.

- **Full-stack** — Write scalable code and system design; architecture design; deploy securely, automate everything in between; design for reliability and scalability
- **System design & large-scale infrastructure** — Scalable architectures, distributed systems, trade-off-driven design. From 0–1 and 1,000 to 100,000+ daily active user applications; production systems that stay up, critical applications with clear trade-offs.
- **DevOps** — CI/CD, observability, and automation that improve developer experience; incident response and on-call; cost and efficiency. Faster delivery, lower MTTR.
- **Databases & data** — Data stores—design, reliability, performance
- **ML applications & AI-driven automation** — Deploy production AI, MLOps, RAG, and data science pipelines; build and run agentic workflows; intelligent automation and AI-augmented delivery to sharpen developer productivity
- **Across the stack** — Public-facing, data-driven, ML, and non-public-facing or security applications; I've worked across them
- **Greenfield & brownfield** — Building from scratch or managing and evolving legacy applications

**Areas of Expertise & Interest:**
- DevOps & Platform Engineering
- Security-Focused Software Development
- Cloud-Native Engineering & System Design
- AI/ML Infrastructure & Agentic Workflows
- AI-Driven Automation & Agentic Workflows

I'm dedicated to solving real-world engineering challenges. I'm always exploring modern tools and system designs, and I'm particularly interested in how we can leverage **AI** to build more robust and efficient systems.

## 🏗️ Technical Expertise

*What I can do — in one place. End-to-end ownership from design to production.*

- **Infrastructure & scale:** Run production systems that stay up. 125+ microservices, 300+ application instances, 4TB MySQL, hybrid cloud (GCP + AWS). Multi-environment (DEV, SIT, UAT, PROD), GKE, Nginx/Apache, load balancers, VPC, zero-downtime migrations (mydumper/myloader, gh-ost). Business impact: ₹700 Crore+ revenue backbone, 7M users, 99%+ uptime, 4x traffic spike handling.

- **System design:** Scalable and distributed system architecture—high availability, scalability patterns, disaster recovery, and trade-off-driven design. From application logic to infrastructure; built to grow.

- **Data-driven applications & pipelines:** Build and operate **data-driven** pipelines that move 7M users’ data (PII-handled, legal, anonymous) from MySQL to BigQuery/BigTable. Event-driven (Cloud Function → Dataflow → ETL) and time-driven (Composer DAGs). Kafka, Pub/Sub, DAG sync; consumed by business teams, Data Science, Martech, SCM, legacy panel. Infra only; DE owns warehousing and ETL logic.

- **Data science & AI infra:** Support the ₹700 Crore revenue marketing engine with vector DB (Qdrant), Vertex AI, embeddings, and recommendations. 50–60% cost saving on manual tasks. RAG/sentiment platform: semantic search over influencer content, decision support for brand teams; K8s, GPU pipeline, CI/CD — infra only, no application/RAG code.

- **AI-driven workflow automation & agentic workflows:** Intelligent automation and agentic AI (e.g. MCP, n8n, LLM-backed tooling) for provisioning, lifecycle management, and operations. Use AI to sharpen delivery, reduce toil, and improve how systems are run.

- **Observability & reliability:** Unified Prometheus + Grafana stack, real-time alerting, CI/CD integration, automated escalation. 76% MTTR reduction (30min → 7min) across 125+ microservices. So teams see issues first and fix faster.

- **IaC & automation:** Terraform, Ansible, GitOps (ArgoCD). Reusable modules for GKE, Cloud SQL, VPCs, load balancers. Single source of truth; 40%+ faster deployments, 40%+ provisioning automated. Jenkins, GitLab CI, Slack.

- **Security & compliance:** Zero-trust architecture, automated IAM minimization, Kubernetes RBAC, Trivy, Secrets Manager, SSO. 100% coverage across workloads. DPDP, ISO 27001, NIST, CIS, OWASP.

- **Legacy & modern together:** Revenue management panel backbone so business teams run operations (banner, campaigns, Martech, logistics) without technical intervention. Legacy PHP monolith + internal load balancer + distributed K8s; one panel, infra-only ownership.

- **AdTech & high-traffic platforms:** In-house AdTech for ₹400+ Crore revenue, 93% cost reduction, 4x traffic spike handling. POS for 100+ retail stores, ₹40+ Crores revenue, 99%+ uptime. Multi-cloud, Kafka, Redis, real-time processing.
