### 👋 Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub space.

I’m **Kushal Gupta**, a **Software Engineer** passionate about solving problems and building secure, scalable, and efficient systems.

I work at the intersection of **platform engineering**, **DevOps**, **cloud infrastructure**, and **security-first development**—with a strong focus on improving developer experience and enabling teams to deliver faster and safer.

💡 I'm always exploring new technologies, experimenting with tools, and learning about cloud-native solutions, automation, and software architecture.

I also share my work and learning through my [personal website](https://thisiskushal31.github.io/) where you’ll find my projects, blogs, and more.
