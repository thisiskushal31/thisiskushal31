# 👋 Hey there, I'm Kushal Gupta

Welcome to my GitHub space! I'm an **Experienced Software Engineer** with a proven track record building, deploying, and operating large-scale production-grade systems. I write full-stack code, deploy it securely, leverage AI-driven solutions, ensure reliability, and automate everything in between. End-to-end ownership from infrastructure design to monitoring and reliability, with a focus on security, reliability, and scalability.

**Areas of Expertise & Interest:**
- DevOps & Platform Engineering
- Security-Focused Software Development
- Cloud-Native Engineering & System Design

I'm dedicated to solving real-world engineering challenges. I'm always exploring modern tools and system designs, and I'm particularly interested in how we can leverage **AI** to build more robust and efficient systems.

## 🏗️ Technical Expertise

- **Engineering Approach:** Full-stack development (application logic to infrastructure automation), security-first deployment (zero-trust, automated IAM, secrets management, Kubernetes RBAC), AI-driven solutions (intelligent automation, agentic workflows), reliability engineering (observability, automated incident response), automation-first (IaC, CI/CD, GitOps)

- **Core Capabilities:** System architecture & design (scalable architectures, IaC, CI/CD, observability), production-grade engineering (zero-trust networking, automated IAM, secrets management, Kubernetes RBAC), cloud-native expertise (Multiple Microservices Distributed Workload on Kubernetes across multi-environment setups)

- **Infrastructure & Platform Engineering:** Multiple Microservices Distributed Workload on Kubernetes (DEV, SIT, UAT, PROD), 300+ application instances, 200+ self-managed database instances, 4TB MySQL databases, multi-zone deployments, hybrid cloud (GCP + AWS) with Route53, GKE, Cloud SQL, ALB, GCLB, microservices with kubedns service discovery. 

- **IaC & Automation:** Terraform (reusable modules for GKE, Cloud SQL, VPCs, Load Balancers), Ansible (configuration management, system hardening), GitOps as single source of truth, CI/CD modernization (Jenkins scripted pipelines with Slack) — **Result:** 40%+ faster deployments, 40%+ provisioning tasks automated. 

- **Database Operations:** Minimal downtime migrations (mydumper/myloader for migrations, gh-ost for large table alterations on 4TB MySQL, few hours), automated master/slave management, backup automation (MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch), DR with PITR

- **Observability & Monitoring:** Unified observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, GCP Stackdriver) with automated escalation, CI/CD integration (Jenkins + Slack alerts), monitoring 125+ Microservices Distributed Workload and 300+ application instances across multi-environment — **Result:** 76% MTTR reduction (30min → 7min)

- **Security & Compliance:** Container security (Kubernetes RBAC, Secure Boot, automated IAM minimization, Trivy scanning), microservices security (Secrets Manager, SSO, IP whitelisting, zero-trust architecture), compliance (DPDP, ISO 27001/27018/27017/27002, NIST, CIS, OWASP)

- **AI-Powered Automation:** Agentic AI-based Elasticsearch cluster management (n8n, Terraform, Ansible, Python) for streamlined provisioning, lifecycle management, and automated operations
