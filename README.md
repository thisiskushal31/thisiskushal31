I'm dedicated to solving real-world engineering challenges. I'm always exploring modern tools and system designs, and I'm particularly interested in how we can leverage **AI** to build more robust and efficient systems.

## 🏗️ Technical Expertise

**Engineering Approach:**
- **Full-Stack Development:** Write code across the stack, from application logic to infrastructure automation
- **Secure Deployment:** Deploy applications with security-first principles, implementing zero-trust patterns, automated IAM policies, secrets management, and Kubernetes RBAC
- **AI-Driven Solutions:** Leverage AI for intelligent automation, agentic workflows, and enhanced system capabilities
- **Reliability Engineering:** Build resilient systems with observability (Prometheus/Grafana), automated incident response, and proactive monitoring
- **Automation-First:** Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible), CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub CI), and GitOps workflows

**Core Capabilities:**
- **System Architecture & Design:** Design scalable architectures, implement Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible), build CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub CI), and integrate observability (Prometheus/Grafana) with security hardening
- **Production-Grade Engineering:** Implement zero-trust networking, automated IAM policies, secrets management, Kubernetes RBAC, and infrastructure-as-code best practices
- **Cloud-Native Expertise:** Managed 125+ Kubernetes deployments on GKE, ensuring production reliability and scalability across multi-environment setups

- **Backup Automation:** Automated backups for MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch using Python/Bash with cron scheduling
- **Disaster Recovery:** Engineered DR and backup plans for databases and VMs with Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)

### Observability & Monitoring

**Unified Observability Stack:**
- **Prometheus & Grafana:** Architectured unified observability stack with real-time monitoring and automated escalation
