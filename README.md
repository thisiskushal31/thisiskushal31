# 👋 Hey there, I'm Kushal Gupta

Welcome to my GitHub space! I'm a **Software Engineer** who writes full-stack code, deploys it securely, leverages AI-driven solutions, ensures reliability, and automates everything in between. Building and operating production-grade infrastructure at scale with a focus on infrastructure automation, observability, security, and system reliability.

**Areas of Expertise & Interest:**
- DevOps & Platform Engineering
- Security-Focused Software Development
- Cloud-Native Engineering & System Design

I'm dedicated to solving real-world engineering challenges. I'm always exploring modern tools and system designs, and I'm particularly interested in how we can leverage **AI** to build more robust and efficient systems.

## 🏗️ Technical Expertise

- **Engineering Approach:** Full-stack development (application logic to infrastructure automation), security-first deployment (zero-trust, automated IAM, secrets management, Kubernetes RBAC), AI-driven solutions (intelligent automation, agentic workflows), reliability engineering (observability, automated incident response), automation-first (IaC, CI/CD, GitOps)

- **Core Capabilities:** System architecture & design (scalable architectures, IaC, CI/CD, observability), production-grade engineering (zero-trust networking, automated IAM, secrets management, Kubernetes RBAC), cloud-native expertise (125+ Kubernetes deployments on GKE across multi-environment setups)

- **Infrastructure & Platform Engineering:** 125+ Kubernetes deployments on GKE (DEV, SIT, UAT, PROD), 300+ compute instances, 4TB MySQL databases, multi-zone deployments, hybrid cloud (GCP + AWS) with Route53, GKE, Cloud SQL, ALB, GCLB, microservices with kubedns service discovery. **IaC & Automation:** Terraform (reusable modules for GKE, Cloud SQL, VPCs, Load Balancers), Ansible (configuration management, system hardening), GitOps workflows, CI/CD modernization (Jenkins scripted pipelines with Slack) — **Result:** 40%+ faster deployments, 40%+ provisioning tasks automated. **Database Operations:** Zero-downtime migrations (gh-ost on 4TB MySQL), automated master/slave management, backup automation (MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch), DR with PITR

- **Observability & Monitoring:** Unified observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, GCP Stackdriver) with automated escalation, CI/CD integration (Jenkins + Slack alerts), monitoring 125+ K8s deployments and 300+ compute instances across multi-environment — **Result:** 76% MTTR reduction (30min → 7min)

- **Security & Compliance:** Container security (Kubernetes RBAC, Secure Boot, automated IAM minimization, Trivy scanning), microservices security (Secrets Manager, SSO, IP whitelisting, zero-trust architecture), compliance (DPDP, ISO 27001/27018/27017/27002, NIST, CIS, OWASP)

- **AI-Powered Automation:** Agentic AI-based Elasticsearch cluster management (n8n, Terraform, Ansible, Python) for streamlined provisioning, lifecycle management, and automated operations
