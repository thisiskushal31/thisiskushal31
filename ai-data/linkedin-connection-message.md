## 📋 LinkedIn Connection Request Strategy

### Step 1: Send Connection Request (300 character limit)
Use **Template 4** or **Template 2** - keep it short and professional.

### Step 2: After They Accept (Follow-up message)
Send **Template 1** or **Template 3** with more details about your experience and what you're looking for.

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Personalize when possible:**
   - Mention something specific about their profile/company
   - Reference mutual connections if any
   - Show you've done your research

2. **Keep connection requests short:**
   - LinkedIn limits connection requests to 300 characters
   - Save detailed info for follow-up messages

3. **Be professional but friendly:**
   - Avoid being too salesy
   - Focus on building genuine connections
   - Offer value, not just ask for help

4. **Include your CV link:**
   - Make it easy for them to review your background
   - Use a shareable link (Google Drive works well)
