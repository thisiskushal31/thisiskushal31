## 📋 LinkedIn Connection Request Strategy

### Step 1: Send Connection Request (300 character limit)
Use **Template 4** or **Template 2** - keep it short and professional.

### Step 2: After They Accept (Follow-up message)
Send **Template 1** or **Template 3** with more details about your experience and what you're looking for.

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Personalize when possible:**
   - Mention something specific about their profile/company
   - Reference mutual connections if any
   - Show you've done your research

2. **Keep connection requests short:**
   - LinkedIn limits connection requests to 300 characters
   - Save detailed info for follow-up messages

3. **Be professional but friendly:**
   - Avoid being too salesy
   - Focus on building genuine connections
   - Offer value, not just ask for help

4. **Include your CV link:**
   - Make it easy for them to review your background
   - Use a shareable link (Google Drive works well)

---

## 💡 Customization Tips

**For Recruiters:**
- Add: "I noticed you recruit for DevOps roles..."
- Mention: "I'd be interested in learning about opportunities you're working on"
- **Important:** Always mention your notice period (60 days, negotiable) - this helps recruiters plan timelines

**For Hiring Managers:**
- Add: "I'm impressed by [Company]'s work in [specific area]..."
- Mention: "I'd love to learn more about your team's DevOps practices"

**For Industry Professionals:**
