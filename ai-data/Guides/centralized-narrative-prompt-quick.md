# Quick Prompt: Centralized Narrative Management

Copy this into a new chat to get started:

---

I need to establish a **single source of truth** for my professional narrative that syncs across multiple platforms while preserving each platform's unique purpose.

## Current State:
- **`/ai-data/career-context.md`** (734 lines) - LinkedIn source of truth
- **`/ai-data/freelancer-profile.md`** (446 lines) - Freelancer platforms source of truth
- **GitHub README** - Tech-savvy individual who learns things
- **Portfolio Website** - Professional presence
- **LinkedIn** - Job opportunities (Software Engineer full-fledged coming soon)
- **Blog** - Manager-level insights
- **DocHub** - Technical deep dives
- **Bio Link** - Central hub

## Platform Requirements:

| Platform | Audience | Tone | Focus |
|----------|----------|------|-------|
| **Freelancer** | International clients | Business-driven, ROI | "Software Engineer full-fledged" - cost savings, revenue |
| **GitHub** | Tech-savvy developers | Technical, learning | Tech-savvy individual - architecture, implementation |
| **LinkedIn** | Recruiters, hiring managers | Professional | "Software Engineer full-fledged" - career progression |
| **Portfolio** | Mixed audience | Professional | Projects, experience, journey |
| **Blog** | Managers | Strategic, accessible | High-level topics → link to DocHub |
| **DocHub** | Technical audience | No non-sense | Deep technical documentation |

## Goals:
1. Single source of truth (update once, sync everywhere)
2. Consistent narrative (same story, adapted for audience)
3. Platform-specific optimization (right tone, right focus)
4. AI-friendly structure
5. Scalable (easy to add platforms)

## Key Data to Centralize:
- Professional title: "Software Engineer" (full-fledged)
- Experienced Software Engineer with proven track record
- Key metrics: 125+ K8s deployments, 7M users, $84M+ revenue systems, 93% cost reduction, 76% MTTR reduction, 40%+ faster deployments, 99%+ uptime
- Projects: Purplle.com, PurplleAds, Nexus POS, Infrastructure Automation, Monitoring, Security, Elasticsearch
- Proof of work: https://github.com/thisiskushal31/thisiskushal31/tree/main/projects
- Technical stack: Python, JavaScript, GCP, AWS, Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes, CI/CD, databases, monitoring, security

## What I Need:
1. **Recommended architecture** (master data file structure)
2. **Platform-specific transformation rules** (how to adapt content)
3. **Implementation plan** (migration strategy, steps)
4. **AI prompt templates** (for generating platform content)
5. **Maintenance workflow** (how to keep in sync)

**Constraints:**
- Must work with existing files
- Must be maintainable by one person
- Must scale as career evolves
- Must be AI-friendly

**Please provide a comprehensive plan before implementation.**
