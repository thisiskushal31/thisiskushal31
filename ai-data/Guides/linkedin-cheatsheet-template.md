If you're preparing for [YOUR TOPIC] interviews, here's a practical cheatsheet that can help. Instead of just understanding how to handle tools, think in use cases. Here's the breakdown:

1. [Topic 1 Name]
   • [Key insight or tool]
   • [Key concept]
   • [Real-world application]

2. [Topic 2 Name]
   • [Key insight or tool]
   • [Key concept]
   • [Real-world application]

3. [Topic 3 Name]
   • [Key insight or tool]
   • [Key concept]
   • [Real-world application]

4. [Topic 4 Name]
   • [Key insight or tool]
   • [Key concept]
   • [Real-world application]

5. [Topic 5 Name]
   • [Key insight or tool]
   • [Key concept]
   • [Real-world application]

6. [Topic 6 Name]
   • [Key insight or tool]
   • [Key concept]
   • [Real-world application]

7. [Topic 7 Name]
   • [Key insight or tool]
   • [Key concept]
   • [Real-world application]

8. [Topic 8 Name]
   • [Key insight or tool]
   • [Key concept]
   • [Real-world application]

9. [Topic 9 Name]
   • [Key insight or tool]
   • [Key concept]
   • [Real-world application]

How to study [YOUR TOPIC] (my advice):
→ Understand the core building blocks
→ Learn how they connect in real architectures
→ Always ask why this tool is used here

This isn't an exhaustive list ~ but you should also look into topics like [Additional Topic 1], [Additional Topic 2], [Additional Topic 3]

It will help you move beyond "I've used the tool" answers. What else would you add that should be covered?
