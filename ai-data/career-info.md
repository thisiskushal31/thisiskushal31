**Copy-Paste Ready Format:**
```
I'm an Experienced Software Engineer with proven track record building, deploying, and operating large-scale production-grade systems across cloud, managed services, and VM-based environments. I work at the intersection of software development and platform engineering—owning systems end to end, from infrastructure design and deployment to monitoring, reliability, and production operations. I focus on understanding the "why" behind technical decisions and choosing the best system design for each problem, ensuring solutions are not just functional but optimal for the specific context. I've contributed to high-availability platforms, reduced operational overhead through automation, and improved system performance, resilience, and cost efficiency at scale. I place a strong emphasis on security, reliability, and scalability, focusing on building systems that are easy to operate, resilient under load, and aligned with real business needs.

• End-to-end system ownership: Infrastructure → Deployment → Monitoring → Reliability
• System design: Understanding the "why" and choosing the best architecture for each problem
• Cloud platforms: GCP, AWS with Kubernetes-based and self-managed deployments
• CI/CD & Infrastructure: Pipeline design, Infrastructure as Code, observability systems
• Platform engineering: Automation, developer tooling, and production operations
• High ownership: Comfortable with ambiguous requirements, cross-functional collaboration
